Conclusion

Cluster 0: This cluster includes customers with moderate to high balance and purchase activity. They have a relatively high frequency of purchases and a mix of one-off and installment purchases. Their cash advance activity is low, and they tend to have a moderate credit limit. They make regular payments but may have a higher minimum payment ratio.

Cluster 1: Customers in this cluster exhibit high purchase activity, with a high frequency of purchases, particularly one-off purchases. They have a relatively low balance and cash advance activity. Their credit limit is generally high, and they make regular payments, with a lower minimum payment ratio.

Cluster 2: This cluster represents customers with relatively low balance and purchase activity. They have a low frequency of purchases and minimal cash advance activity. Their credit limit tends to be lower compared to other clusters. They make regular payments, with a moderate minimum payment ratio.
